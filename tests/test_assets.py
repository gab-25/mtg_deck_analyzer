"""Guards that the templates only use assets the vendored bundles actually ship.

The stylesheet (`theme/static/css/styles.css`) and the icon font
(`materialsymbols-subset.woff2`) are pre-built artifacts committed to the repo:
there is no Tailwind build step and no subsetting script here. So a template can
reference a utility class or an icon that simply does not exist, and nothing
fails — the markup renders, silently unstyled. That is exactly how the
statistics panel shipped with a flat mana curve (`h-[140px]` was never
compiled) and a `query_stats` icon rendered as literal text.

These tests are cheap and catch that whole class of bug at its source.
